## ElectroMagnetic Simulation in Geophysics

**emsig** are open-source codes to simulate electromagnetic data. Their main
targets are geophysical applications (exploration and monitoring, engineering,
environmental), but they are by no means limited to that. Currently there are
two main codes, [empymod](https://empymod.emsig.xyz) and
[emg3d](https://emg3d.emsig.xyz). The former is a 3D code for layered media,
the latter is a low-memory multigrid solver for 3D media. Both are written in
Python and released under the permissive Apache-2.0 license.
